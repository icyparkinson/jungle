  <h2>Overview</h2>
  
  This is a full stack e-commerce website inspired by Amazon made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Node, and MongoDB. It has a fully functioning shopping cart feature that allows users to add and delete items from a shopping cart. The shopping cart displays the current order with the current subtotal of all the items in the cart. The user may also update the quantity of each item from their respective pages or from the shopping cart.
  
  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  Click on any item from the home page to see a description page and a button to add the desired quantity of the item to the shopping cart. Once added, you'll be redirected to the shopping cart, where you can see a list of all the items in your shopping cart and edit the quantities of any item in the cart.
